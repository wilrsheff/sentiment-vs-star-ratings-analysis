Facebook,"Notifications don't seem to work anymore. I have to open and manually refresh notifications to see any updates. Never had issues in the past, and in recent months I'm discovering comments on posts that I never got a notification about. It only started in the last month, and I didn't change settings. I double checked settings, but no improvements... It makes it difficult to track when I'm posting items to give away if I don't know anybody has commented without going to the posts to check.",2.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Please reset the search options. I used to be able to search within a specific group, page, or feed. Unfortunately, now, when you try to use the search feature, it searches all of Facebook. It's not useful at all. It makes it difficult when the results are completely out of your area. Please change the search option back to searching in a specific group, page, or community. Thank you so much!",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"3/2/23: Can you please stop making every update come with a default back to videos on my timeline automatically playing with sound? Is that really the more popular option? My guess is no, since I know that many people scroll silently in public. 3/5/25: Two years later, I'm coming back again to complain about the fact that I turned off auto play sound on videos about four times this month, and it keeps turning itself back on. And still crazy to me that this would be the default option.",2.0,Google Play
Facebook,I wish I didn't have to use it. video live streams don't work right. I try and watch it horizontally on my phone and the app places half the screen beneath my phone. the top half of the video is the bottom half of my screen. when I try and vertically align it after that point the video is switched and will keep playing the wrong video no matter how many times I try and get back into it. That's on top of all the other well-known garbage that Facebook shoves in your feed instead of what you want,1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Many bad updates recently. Many notifications are now categorised as conversations, so they don't respect that I've silenced them, and this can't be disabled. Top navigation bar often doesn't load. Reels jump to the next one 5 seconds before the previous one finishes. Videos autoplay despite autoplay being disabled. Links open in a terrible built in browser, so a YouTube video takes 7 taps to open and completely close. There's no user testing, and the app gets worse with every update. Awful.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Constantly freezes and shuts down. They never seem to fix the issues. I'll have a decent run, then suddenly my phone starts freezing all because, surprise! FB has a bug again! Maybe it's just an android issue, but it shouldn't be an ongoing problem. I've asked other people who also have androids, and they have the same issues.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"The notifications tab rarely loads. Notifications are also usually out of order and will switch order before your eyes with no apparent organizing logic. The top bar isn't visible unless I scroll down and back up. The ""Most Relevant"" feature for comments makes it near impossible to see a long conversation on a busy thread because there's no way to switch to ""All comments"" without losing your place. Help features are a joke. I could write pages on how this app has become over the past 5 years.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,Facebook games are very unstable!!!! I play Ludo World often and it's a great game but it force closes and glitches too often. Fix this please. If you're going to offer games on the app they should work!!! Also the number of ads is ridiculous!!! ESPECIALLY when I watch the whole ad then get kicked out of the game before I get the reward and have to watch it a second or sometime 3rd time to get the rewards!! Its like you're tricking people into watching multiple ads for nothing!!! DIRTY TACTICS!!,1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"I can't stand the Of course no response and no fixes. Marketplace when in local brings up items from across the US before local ads. When searching for an item, it should bring up that item regardless of location starting from the closest one, not everything else not related. When scrolling through local items I can be 50 items down, click an item to view it and when going back to the list it starts at the top again. Frustrating! No way to contact Facebook to report",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"12/11/24 With the last update, it consistently fails. It won't go to pressed tabs. Can't see notifications, messages or the like. When able to get to messages, can't reply to messages. Tried uninstalling w/ no luck. _______ This used to be a decent app. In the last few months, most images on profiles (even mine) show up as a black screen. I had the issue on my original phone, cleared the memory cache, but still had the issue. I got a replacement phone, and still have that problem. Please help!",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"There's a lot of things that could be done better. starting with how the page jumps and you lose EVERYTHING while you're working on a message. That gets lost. Or like right now as I type this, the box is jumping all over the place! How do you make it stop? And the Draft situation has GOT to be fixed. I can save a draft or hope that my message drafts and it doesn't. Instead, it gets lost in no man's land. But that never happens. And a bunch of work ends up for naught. Wasted time too.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Super buggy lately. Hasn't updated my notifications in 2 days and everytime I reload them, it still shows the latest notification being 2 days ago. Also, anytime I watch a video from Messenger, and hit the back arrow after the video is over, it takes me to Facebook, not back to messenger, which is super annoying. And I'd like timeline feed to be in chronological order, not random. Even when I change the setting to show that, it reverts back to this random timeline feed.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Pixel 9 pro: if viewing a photo on a profile, the swipe back gesture doesn't work. The screen just flickers and nothing nothing happens. It's only in the Facebook app when viewing photos. Swipe works on all other apps. This is a Facebook app issue. It's happening to other pixel users. I am not able to use the back button at the top of the screen that shows up in the app. The top of the screen is greyed out. It's 2025 Facebook devs, base Android should have a working app!",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"The ads. I can't do it anymore. I will see one post from a friend, then an ad, then a suggestion of an add or a group I should join, and then another ad. I am so over it. I've had Facebook since 2008 and every year it just seems to get worse. What started as a place where friends could post about their happenings in life and keep up with others has now turn into a giant online ad campaign. I hardly use the app anymore because of the ads. I go days without checking it.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"The User Interface of this app is one of the worst I've ever experienced. Over complicated, difficult to find many settings hidden in different ways, and it sends none of the notifications you set to see and sends notifications for everything you don't want, there's lots of privacy concerns with what they do with your information, plenty of fake accounts that impersonate people you have added. The list could go on",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"For an app that's supposed to keep you in the loop with friends and family, it does a really bad job at it. 90% of my feed is ad and suggested content. If I scroll through 20 posts, only a handful are from my friends. I don't even see half the content they post. Not to mention the notifications are useless. Why am I getting a notification about a post made 3-4 DAYS ago?? I have a few dozen friends that I'd like to keep up to date with, but this app makes that almost impossible. Waste of time.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"FB had butchered what used to be great. I rarely see my actual ""friends"" posts. It's filled with content it believes i want to see but don't. It filters my notifications by what it seems important. If I AT ALL watch a video, it's subpar algorithm shows me non stop the same or same type of video. I've kept due to family and pictures but have weened. Won't be active much longer.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"It's crazy how much data this app collects from my device usage OUTSIDE the app for ad targeting. The settings interface to change what data it can collect is not user-friendly at all. If someone isn't tech savy, they would have a hard time finding and adjusting ad and privacy settings. I feel like the settings menu was set up this way purposely. One shouldn't have to google how to change a setting in the app.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"New post... its now 1/1/25 and I am here yet again because for the last week videos won't play in fb. They will play for a very short time and then the ""loading"" circle will appear and then ""there was a problem"" error message. Why does fb NEVER work! I tried uninstall ingredients. It didnt fix it. The last 3 days fb is completely glitchy. SLOW. Won't load anything correctly. I can't select the emotions on people posts, they are all grayed out. Why does this happen so often üòï",2.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Tabs is a useless feature. There is no information about it in the help center or online. No matter what link you hit, even by accident, it remains open in tabs! There is 0 way to access tabs without clicking on a random link. From there you can see what links are open and close them. If you forget, well, then you have to find another random link to click. I can't even find where I can report this to the help center anymore. So, I came here.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,I use Facebook pretty much on a daily basis for a blog. It's a great place to connect with family and friends. And post all kinds of amazing moments in life ‚ù§Ô∏è the only thing I don't like is even whenever Facebook doesn't need to be updated it still manages to show posts from a week ago. Even after 2 days of not being on Facebook. I really wish they would fix this or make it to where the if it acts like this make it happen early update of some type,4.0,Google Play
Facebook,"One of the most important app features (in my opinion) no longer works. I have ""Never Autoplay Videos"" set and videos are never supposed to start with sound, yet my app ignores these setting daily. Between that and an algorithm that increasingly prioritizes ads and weird influencer posts I couldn't care less about, Facebook is becoming worthless. Bold of these problems to keep increasing as Bluesky continues to grow.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Needs Major Improvements While Facebook used to be a convenient way to connect with friends and family, the app has become increasingly frustrating to use. Here are the major issues: 1. Intrusive Ads: The number of ads is overwhelming. Every few posts in my feed are ads, making it hard to see genuine updates from friends. 2. Algorithm Priorities: The feed shows random content from pages and people I don‚Äôt interact with while burying posts from close friends and family.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Updated review: this app just seems to be getting buggier and buggier. Occasionally when I click the profile picture of someone I don't know, it freezes the app on their picture. I can't swipe or exit. Sometimes I have to uninstall and reinstall because all my wall shows is ads and groups... Literally 6 out of 7 posts are groups I don't belong to, or ads. Notifications in app don't work unless manually refreshed. So so many bugs. Clearly, META culture isn't attracting the best developers anymore",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Somebody from China was allowed to access my account, change my email and password associated, and there is zero support that can help me access it again. I've lost pictures from my childhood, lists of friends, and I'm so angry that there's no technical support to be contacted about this. Horrible app, wish I'd have never relied on it for picture storage.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Forced ads in the middle of a video or short isn't the way... super irritating and completely unacceptable to me. I spend 99% of my time watching videos if I'm on Facebook, and I will not be doing it anymore until forced ads are removed. I don't mind seeing them when I am scrolling through videos, but pausing a video to make me watch an ad is ridiculous.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Facebook used to be a great way to stay connected, but now it's a constant stream of annoying ads, spammy content, and irrelevant recommendations. The algorithm seems to prioritize posts that are sensational or controversial instead of the content from friends or pages you actually care about. It's full of privacy concerns too‚Äîthere are constant issues with data leaks and intrusive tracking.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Tapping on the owners page name in a vid doesn't do anything. It should take you to their page. Pics won't load, but when they do, when clicked on half the time you can't zoom or the screen turns black. Really annoying when it's instructions or something you're trying to read. When tapping a notification for a post in a group it NEVER takes you to the post, it takes you to the top of the group page. Pages often don't load. Opening Facebook in my browser is mostly flawless. The app is useless.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Soft locks my Phone constantly. Adpocalypse. Banner ads with fake X buttons. Banner ads placed in such a way to get accidental clicks. Facebook reels have a ""Next Video"" feature that gives you 5-10 seconds to cancel (First click never works, almost by design) or it will ignore the rest of that reel and scroll onto the next one before it is even finished. Every time the next video is an ad. Yes, it skips the video you're trying to watch, for an Advertisement. Uninstalled, good job.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"I would have to say I use Facebook everyday to talk to people but I noticed since I've updated it, it won't allow me to see my cover picture nor anybody else's at that matter as wellü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not sure what to do. I've uninstalled it completely as well and it didn't fix the cover picture problem but its quite frustrating. Any help is appreciated, thanks! I will change to a 5 star if someone can help me get the cover photos thing fixed.",2.0,Google Play
Facebook,"10/3/24: Great update! Negative 17 stars. 75% advertising posts instead of my friends. A lot of times, clicking on stuff doesn't work, so I have to close the app and reopen it. And now it's showing that the app is using way too much storage on my device, which shows a problem to my device's health!! Certain words gets your page flagged but meanwhile I regularly see sexual explicit videos, pics and ads throughout the site. And yall want me to make a thread account... I THINK NOT",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"They keep breaking features. As of the Oct. 2 l, 2024 update I can't search for friends anymore. The search works but when I click on a result or the right arrow beside it nothing at all happens. And the increasing deluge of ads makes me reluctant to open the app to begin with. The idea of staying connected is great but the reality is falling far short.",3.0,Google Play
Facebook,"A lot of bugs. Cannot properly respond to events (overlay sheet is all white with no options), for example. Reporting them doesn't seem to get them fixed, either. Also, why is this app so bloated ?! Internal browser is awful and now is accumulating tabs that don't close. Keep hoping it'll improve, but keeps deteriorating.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"It's slow loading, always randomly closing articles and the app itself, way too many permissions, takes up too much space, crashes when I'm not even using it, and the video buffering is horrendous. The app also post blocking for no reason is absurd and discrimantory. Let's not forget actual PORN being forced on you in the reels as ADS. Why did I see a woman spreading her lips after watching a travel video??? Please fix it.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"I ALWAYS used Facebook on a web browser on a computer, or a mobile browser on a phone. There's absolutely no need for this spyware/malware garbage on your phone. All they are doing is collecting data about you more easily. They claim they're introducing new end to end encryption, but that doesn't do much good when they have back doors into the cipher and then dump all your data to the government. Don't install this trash.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"I like Facebook. Its a very good app. But there are a few glitches, like sometims, you're feed doesn't refresh, and you're stuck with the same posts/feed over and over again, no matter if you refresh or reopen the app. And thats another thing. While that glitch is happening, you can't refresh Facebook, it glitches out, and the refresh circle that pops up goes very fast. Its annoying. Also, I try and get my feed to change, by clicking ""show less"", ""hide reels"" etc, but the stuff keeps coming back",3.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Facebook has become unrecognizable from what it once was. I login today and 9 out of every 10 posts are ads (recommendations for pages I'm not following and random video reels are considered ads). I find it incredibly difficult to tailor my experience to actually seeing posts from friends, or anything I'm actually interested in. it's like the Internet in the 90's without ad blockers. this is just really such a terrible awful social network that does not function as a social network anymore.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"The mobile app is hot garbage. Notifications not loading, messages from the notifications not loading, marketplace almost never showing items near me despite the small radius I chose, the send message button is gone now unless you minimize your keyboard and almost entirely back out of a comment. Seriously terrible, but so is the desktop version. This website sucks and it's barely functional.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"I like messenger. It's a pretty good app for companies to interact with fans. Reels has to be the worst version of short form video. It's the only one that I have encountered that doesn't let you rewind. you have to watch the video all the way through to let it repeat(if it wants, sometimes it skips to the next one) to see what you missed. I would rather watch it once and move on. minus 2 stars just for reels",3.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Across multiple years and multiple phones, this is the buggiest app I've ever used. Notifications have never consistently worked. Help Center pages often fail to load. Hidden ads reappear for a few seconds before becoming hidden again. After updates, the Active Status setting turns on and I have to manually turn it off again. Once I save a post, I can't unsave it. Tapping ""cancel"" while writing a comment often doesn't do anything, so I have to backspace through the whole comment to delete it.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Marketplace Settings Changes I used to have more than three saved searches. it'd tell me if any new ones are recently posted. Easy access to saved items is gone. At least I haven't found it yet. it's pushing an agenda and furthering from personalized settings. Since META, things have declined. User friendly options, personalizing options, load time, freezing, showing more posts from groups I don't follow than my own friends...all have been a big enough problem to where I want to uninstall FB.",2.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Ads, bias, garbage, and more ads. I could scroll for hours and not see 3 posts from people I actually know, or anyone on my friends list. I used to be able to go to feeds and choose to see friends. Now when I do that, it just says you're all caught up, and you've seen everything from your friends and groups. This app has become nothing but sponsored ads. It is no longer a way to connect with people. Uninstalling.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"The last two updates broke the pinch-to-zoom abilities on images & pictures on my phone. Being unable to zoom in on pictures is very frustrating. Especially if I have to take a screenshot to see a friend's picture more clearly. My vision isn't the greatest, so being able to zoom in on images is important. In fact, sometimes when you click on a picture it gets even smaller. Like it shrinks. Kinda like the pictures did if they were the wrong format in 2008. Please fix this issue, Thank you!!",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"I am constantly seeing so many visual bugs. Parts of the screen go black while scrolling, reels will open only showing the bottom half of the video, but on the top part of the screen. And why can I not zoom in on some photos? Some are fine, some will let me zoom in a little, and some won't let me zoom in at all. It's just a very buggy experience. Works much better on iOS.",2.0,Google Play
Facebook,"I recently broke my phone. I can't access any of my important messages from friend or business contacts or even log in because Facebook won't send my two factor verification to anything except the destroyed phone. When I try to verify with my ID or video, it says it can't confirm, even with my password, phone, and email confirmed at least a dozen times throughout the process. Still... nothing. I'm very frustrated with the whole thing. About done with it, honestly.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"First, my account was taken from me. after two days, and working on a new account, I was able to get back in. of course I had reinstalled a few times but now, there's some issue constantly trying to get me to check WhatsApp! I don't have it and I don't want it connected to my facebook. after having so many issues with whatapp messages, I finally installed it. nothing! I've un-installed it, but still can't get rid of the messages always showing up.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,I enjoy the layout but truly only thing I would love to have changed is to be able to organize your saved Facebook reels/videos! there are so many amazing videos that I've saved and would love to be able to put them into folders of some sort so I can actually enjoy them and use them.,2.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Trying to zoom in on photos no longer works, actually zooms out/gets stuck in a weird loop. When I get a notification or reply to a comment on a post it doesnt take me to my comment, I have to dig to find it. Backing out of a post takes me to the top. Can't search within groups anymore. Top navigation bar doesnt appear until I scroll down and back up. Timeline refuses to show in chronological order, get 3 day old posts from NWS at top of feed. Report obvious spammers and nothing gets done.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"My business profile keeps sending me the same notifications, about 10/day. ""Waiting for you. You have new notifications."" I have messed with my settings to get rid of these. I have restarted the app. I have unistalled and reinstalled it, and I have logged out and back in. I am going crazy and about to turn off notifications for fb all together.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Changed phones and get nothing but error codes when trying to log back in. Their account recovery is a joke. I can't tell you how many times I've confirmed my email with the pop-up they prompt, occasionally, at the top of our feeds...and yet they send my recovery email to an inactive account with no way to access. Beyond FRUSTRATING!!",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Ad factory. Social media is dead. New features make app increasingly awkward and not user friendly to use. Every interaction is designed to bring you to more advertisements, and make it more difficult to seek out content you are actually interested in. It's like being a mouse in a maze, but instead of cheese at the end, it's electric shocks around every corner.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Scroll up after seeing a video? get a black box covering half the screen. The user interface is full of stupid easy to fix errors, not to mention the company's terrible privacy policies. The app will literally cut off the bottom part of letters that go below the normal line (ex: p y g). Used to be a decent way to find local events, now it's full of ai slop. Adds no value to my life anymore. Will be deleting account soon.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"For the last year I've had a glitch that has survived 3 phones and countless updates where if I leave a comment on a video, then get a notification about that comment and click on the notification the app takes me to a random video and I never see the comment that the notification is referencing. other than that I don't like the amount of ads or the amount of ""suggested post"" I see especially when the whole purpose of the app is to follow people to see their timelines.",2.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Sometimes I get notifications. Sometimes I don't. Sometimes when I check notifications the app will act like I never checked them. I'm constantly seeing post from days ago appear in my feed repeatedly, and the ads are way too constant. Edit: 10-7-20 Now I can't access my ad preferences to manage it. It won't load.

I want an option to shut this off.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"The app's gotten more crowded & convoluted in the past 2-3 years than I'd have ever thought possible from one of the world's leading tech companies. Too many ""buttons"" that do the same thing & lead to the same places. Less = more. The new ""Saved"" menu is trash; you can't even see the date you added them. Why'd you remove the ability to use an external browser? I know all you lot EVER see is $, but there are a ton of up & coming competitors. One day you'll be usurped. :) Pleasant thought.",2.0,Google Play
Facebook,"I‚Äôve been using Facebook for years, but for some reason, the Reels and Videos tab is missing from my account. I‚Äôve updated the app, cleared cache, logged in from different devices, even reported the issue from the app, but there‚Äôs been no fix. Other accounts on the same phone have the Reels feature, so the issue is clearly account-specific. Please look into this and restore the feature. It‚Äôs really frustrating not being able to view or post Reels when others can..",3.0,Google Play
Facebook,Ain't no point in saying anything there is no actual service for anything Facebook anymore. I use the app to stay in contact with a few people I physically can't go see.

Facebook,"Won't let me use my default browser to open links by default. Also, they added the link history ""feature"" to their internal browser, then proceeded to repeatedly ask me if I wanted to turn it on even though I kept answering no.

Facebook,My previous phone crashed and since getting a new one I cannot reset my password or access my Facebook account. I have tried resetting it by email and text to no avail. I went to my cell phone carrier and they were not able to fix it either. I googled customer service and the links were the same as I have already tried multiple times. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times. I am at my wits end. I don't know how to contact anyone for help. No help from Meta at all.,1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"App used to work fine. During the past week, it has been crashing when of full mode (Z Fold 5). If I am using the front screen, it works well; however, as soon as I open the phone to use the double screen, it crashes immediately. I will have to delete it. The front screen is not big enough.

Facebook,"If you enjoy watching to the end of the videos you're watching, don't bother doing that on facebook, it'll skip the ending and move you right to the next video. it's annoying AF.

Facebook,with every update the app gets worse. it's full of ads. when trying to watch a reel I see multiple ads at the bottom of the page. I hit the x to dismiss them and a new one shows up. now I'm seeing ads for alcohol and I've been sober for 20 years. very disappointing app. It's time to delete this old app and move on to something not meta related.,1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"It's amazing how deficient the app is given the number of years and the amount of resources invested into it. Probably reliability and bug fixes are low on their priority list. Definitely lower than randomly moving things around. Also, the advertising load is pretty overwhelming at this point and is getting larger over time.",2.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Ads here are fraudulent. When you press the ""x"" on many of their ads while watching videos most of these don't work. When you press on it 1 time it takes you to the ads page. You think its an accident and go back, try again and it repeats. After a few attempts it gets to a point that the ""x"" is no longer clickable but the ad never disappeares from the reel. Ive been monitoring this algorithm for a while and it's insane how this app wants to push down your throat ads.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"This app is very likely ruining your experience with your phone from one little detail--it has an in-app browser you cannot disable. That's right. Every time you click a link, it's not opening your default browser, it's opening Facebooks browser. And it's not just a new window, it's a new tab. You probably have tens (if not hundreds) of tabs open. The worst part is that you CAN NOT disable this feature. At this stage I truly am considering removing the app entirely from my phone.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"I'm starting to dislike Facebook. Too often, I open the app, see an interesting article or post, and then, with the slightest movement or accidental touch, it vanishes‚Äîreplaced by something irrelevant.

It's frustrating, irritating, and makes the experience feel unpredictable and annoying.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"Facebook has gotten awful! Everytime I play a video or reel, it seems to freeze but the audio keeps going. I literally have to pause and unpuse it every ten seconds for it to play again. Newsfeed is a joke. Lots of ads, posts from groups or pages that I don't even follow, and I don't see friends posts as much as I used to.

Completely random slop.",1.0,Google Play
Facebook,"the amount of bugs I've been experiencing over the last few years is ridiculous. At one point, I couldn't even get logged in because it wouldn't send me a code. Another time, I deactivated my account for about a week, logged back in, and had notifications. So the deactivation didn't even work.

It's really shady stuff.",1.0,Google Play

The whole META AI ask meta feature is dumb. Super annoying because it made a simple search harder. Constantly drags/is slow or glitching.,1.0,Google Play

Spotify,"Spotify is practically unusable free unless you're on PC. That's the only reason I give an extra star rather than just one. Even when you're on PC, you're getting around 2-4 30-second long ads every few songs even after ""30 minutes of ad-free listening"". On mobile, you can't turn shuffle off. Every time you go to play a song, it plays just the right amount of songs that AREN'T the song you clicked play for so that you use up all of your 6 free skips for the hour on the songs you had to go past.",2.0,Google Play

Zoom,You can't turn off the sound you can only reduce it to a medium level which is still loud. The only way to mute is to disconnect from audio and then there's no way to reconnect to audio unless you leave and rejoin. Then if you plug a headphone in it doesn't even switch to it. Basically you're forced to play the audio on the speakers. Really dumb and absolutely awful. The middle manager who came up with this should be fired.,1.0,Google Play
Zoom,"Unusable. Unbelievably terrible UI, I'm honestly impressed. Why can't this app use my earbuds for audio automatically when literally every other app I've ever used has never had this problem?

It's better in every single way.",1.0,Google Play

It really needs to be streamlined.",2.0,Google Play
Zoom,Zoom Workplace is a complete change from what we are used to. We were not given any warning as to the change and when we connected with our meeting everything was set to the original settings.

I'm 15 and you're supposed to be 13+ and it STILL doesn't let me go live. 3. Whenever I try and like videos it doesn't let me. And 4. I don't like the fact that it looks weird when I lyp sync.

I've been using Netflix for years and this started happening recently. The problem is not caused by my phone, because I have no issues with YouTube, Prime or HBO.",2.0,Google Play
Netflix,"I don't know what's happened to this app, the viewing controls bug out- If it weren't for my Home app it would be unusable. often it won't even open. sick to death of rebooting & uninstalling then reinstalling. Netflix don't seem to give a rats arse. no updates to fix the issues that have been going on for a year... reducing to one star.",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"I love netflix but I'm curious about one thing, why doesn't it keep movies there, you be scrolling and you find a movie, soon leaving...also why are some series incomplete and take really long to add a new season, some movies are not on Netflix yet they are a Netflix original.. so those issues gotta be fixed foreal but otherwise it's a cool app.",3.0,Google Play
Netflix,"Has subtitles for everything. Thank you! I am not deaf, but I still appreciate having them. Only Netflix consistently has subtitles on every show and movie. 5 STARS. -------- -------- Update: APRIL 2025. I've been a subscriber for 10 years, since 2015. They just bumped my $12 plan up to $19 this month. For ad-free viewing, that is absolutely ridiculous. I'm downgrading to the ad plan for one month to finish a few shows, then cancelling altogether. I'm done.",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"No HD or HDR Playback on Xiaomi Pad 6 I‚Äôve been using the Netflix app on my Xiaomi Pad 6, and it‚Äôs really disappointing that it doesn‚Äôt stream content in HD or HDR. My device supports both, and I‚Äôm on a plan that allows HD streaming, with a fast and stable internet connection. Despite this the app only plays in SD quality, and there‚Äôs no option to manually switch to HD or HDR. It‚Äôs frustrating, especially for a service known for high-quality content. Netflix really needs to fix this issue.",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"Netflix is awesome - My family have used it since forever. 0 technical issues, also there are ads there a far less than most experiences. Although sometimes it says there's no internet (there was) it has amazing quality! I did take a star off because some anime series aren't all on there. Take My Hero Acedamia - Half of the series aren't on there. If Netflix added the rest of the series for everything, now THAT would be 5 stars. xx P.S. Please make this happen, I'm missing out on tons.. 9.5/10",4.0,Google Play
Netflix,Cant watch on 2 different homes on 2 devices for this plan. i travel a lot. when i login to a different tv like a hotel the access on my permanent home gets locked out. my family there cant use it if i use it when im on a trip. i would be stuck in the mobile on a small screen. at lease thave the option to cast it to the tv hotel. the subscription price is higher than most streaming platforms should have this option available for this price.,2.0,Google Play
Netflix,"The brightness fades consistently. it's been like this for months! I thought by now the app would be updated to fix it but nothing so far. As someone rightly stated, we pay SO much for Netflix but for some reason they can't be bothered fixing a basic issue. There's so much I hate about Netflix with it's new ads, games etc but this brightness issue is probably the worst.",2.0,Google Play
Netflix,"I‚Äôm extremely frustrated with the Netflix app. It has completely stopped working ‚Äî every time I try to open it, all I see is a loading screen that never progresses. I have a stable, high-speed internet connection, and all my other apps are working perfectly fine. I‚Äôve cleared cache, reinstalled the app multiple times, restarted my phone, and even updated everything ‚Äî but nothing helps. please fix this issue ASAP!",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"I unsubscribed a few months ago, because the movies I already saw many times are still there. After updates, nothing new. So I stopped with Netflix. I even chat with them, to be sure that I would be disconnected. They still try to get the monthly fee from my bank, but I don't use it anymore, because it's expensive if I cannot watch nice movies. Don't they use any administration or what ?",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"It's pretty neat, the app works smoothly, never crashes. But it severely lacks in quality of life, for example there is no sleep timer, there is no auto skip intro, the brightness level is finicky and sometimes you can't get the lowest setting no matter how hard you try and it switches from your own phone brightness to the in app brightness. Also there isn't really a regional price or its not that well priced, kinda expensive. And their game ads are obnoxious, too much in the face.",3.0,Google Play
Netflix,"Currently I am unable to watch shows that I want to because of some bug. No searching specific titles and no continue watching. Customer support is useless. All it has a troubleshooting thing with articles on what to do, but if they don't work, well, tough luck. We also pay for this service. It's like buying a car and it breaks down before getting to the road. Definitely fair",2.0,Google Play
Netflix,"Tap screen while watching and controls come up. So far so good. Tap again aaaaannd nothing. You cant tap away the controls. You just have to wait until they go away. So im ditting there watching the controls cover subtitles for 10s. And the odd time they just stay there and don't go away. Every single other touch screen video player ever in the history of touch screens has this figured out. Somehow Netflix got missed this one obvious, necessary, and above all, very simple feature.",2.0,Google Play
Netflix,"Updating my payment method on Netflix has been a nightmare. I‚Äôve tried multiple times, but it still doesn‚Äôt work. Instead of giving a vague error message like ‚ÄòThere appears to be a problem with the payment method,‚Äô why not actually specify what the issue is? Is it the card? The bank? Something on Netflix‚Äôs end? A clear, step-by-step solution would be much more helpful instead of leaving customers guessing. This is incredibly frustrating, it shouldn't be this difficult to update a simple payment",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"I received a warning from Netflix while using the app, telling me that I need to disable my VPN. When I clicked OK, it showed me a different list of series and movies than I had initially! Until recently, I was watching The Rookie, which I can no longer find! I called Vodafone, they reset the internet and changed the settings for mobile data. I also reinstalled the Netflix app on my phone, but I still can't find the mentioned series! Did you change the available list without letting us know?!?!",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"It's hit and miss. For someone who finds modern movies boring and lacking creativity and gripping storylines the options for nostalgic movies from the 80s, 90s and 2000s is limited. A lot of the movies are being marked ""leaving soon"" and/or removed already. Finding something to watch is proving to be a struggle as a result. Maybe it's just my own taste that's the issue",3.0,Google Play
Netflix,"My family has used Netflix for over 10 years with no issues. UNTIL TODAY. After being extremely rudely treated by customer service, we were informed: You can no longer use this app to watch if you are out of your house or your family is using the app as well. You have to turn off cellular data even if you are on your own wifi. And must turn on Netflix before leaving the house to be able to use it later, if you need to. This is ridiculous. Do better Netflix.",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"Netflix quickly went from my top streaming app to a terrible non functional app that's taking up space on my phone now. the brightness slider does not work at all, and I can't manually adjust my phone's brightness while playing any media. I get full brightness no matter what the in app slider is set to, and no matter what my phone brightness is at. This has apparently been an issue to lots of other users for quite a long time and it is not being fixed for whatever reason.",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"Brightness level does not support Pixel Extra Dim Feature. The minimum level of brightness of Netflix is very high, and uncomfortable to watch in a dark environment. I found that if I re-install the app it reduces brightness as per Extra Dim, but the moment I try to adjust the brightness, Netflix automatically increases the minimum brightness level again.",2.0,Google Play
Netflix,App was working great until the latest update. Brightness strobes to low every 30 secs then back to the set brightness which is very annoying. I sometimes watch Netflix on my phone especially when I'm travelling but this issue now with the app annoys me so much. Did all the possible solutions as much as I can but still doesn't work. Not sure too if I'm the only one having this issue. Developers please fix. Thanks,3.0,Google Play
Netflix,"The app theme and features ain't all that impressive, but it's good app. Mostly importantly, I pay for Netflix but am not allowed to access all the available movies and series, just because am in a different region than other which is utterly pathetic. The developers should also include a volume and video quality adjustment features and they should also explain to why offline downloads have to expire.",3.0,Google Play
Netflix,Used this app for years and previously had 5 stars. Since the Android update at the end of Feb 25 the app no longer works effectively with Goole Pixel Phones. You have to clear cache and storage and reboot the phone before opening the app twice to get it to work. It won't stay open in the background with inactivity so if you use this app a lot like me it's really not working!! Netflix two weeks on still has no support. (Price has more than doubled yet can't use! Not good netflix!!),1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"what is wrong with the developers, they are not able to fix simple issues. And I have a list of them. Audio is laggy, brightness never works, dimming of screen frequently. There are a lot more. The device I am using is Android. This really makes me unsubscribe from Netflix",3.0,Google Play
Netflix,"I've had a terrible experience with the application recently. On my android, it automatically turns on light mode whenever I open the app, and now I have just reinstalled it and it won't even open now. All I get is a loading screen and it goes on forever. It's become completely unusable and extremely glitchy. did not expect this from Netflix.",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"I love netflix, the interface and the content. But considering its a premium price that I am paying for their content, I should be able to choose at least 2 devices of my choice rather than using 2 devices in the same household. Like we watch netflix only on TV and the second device I would like my mother to have, but she lives in another house and has a different internet connection. The base of the same internet connection to use multiple devices is ridiculous. Rethink your strategy!!!",2.0,Google Play
Netflix,"It is impossible to use the app in a dark environment. I turned off automatic bright control on my Google pixel 9 pro, set screen brightness to very low. as soon I launch the app the screen glows so Brite it lights the whole room. You can't c look at it. I click to play the movie and tried to set bright low in the app itself it works while I keep my thinger on scroll bar. When I release it it glows again. While it plays a movie every 5~10 seconds it redeems bright to normal and set too high!!!!",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"Love almost everything about it, except the overload of little kid shows, removal of content, and inconsistency. By inconsistency I mean having the second movie of a franchise but not the first. Binging Spiderverse movies would be great. And the removal. I hate it so much. My siblings & I like to binge How To Train Your Dragon together, but there's never everything there, and then the movies get removed. It drives me CRAZY. Peak entertainment should stay, not come and go.",3.0,Google Play
Netflix,"Pathetic and hopeless. Why is Netflix such a huge ""tech company"" if they can't make an app that works? The FireTV4K app freezes when you're nearing the completion of your stream. No button works on the remote. You have to press home to exit the app. You can't move to the next episode. On Android, the downloads don't work. It gets stuck on any random percentage and won't move ever. It's like a lucky draw; get stuck>delete>restart, and pray it completes this time. Tons of issues, I can't list all.",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"Watching downloads offline shouldn't count as a screen being used. And this household update is infuriating, good shows are constantly being cancelled, the brightness feature is inconsistent but reliably dark, and half of the subtitles I've seen are useless. Not to mention the recommendations practically being useless and the clutter of the screen, especially on mobiles. Stop cash grabbing and make it better.",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"i just wanted to complain, why not do it in public. customer for years, price has doubled and a few times i have experienced network problems (with the tv, didn't bother watching movies on the phone). first time was with mike tyson (live) and today as well with various movies. wanted to watch oppenheimer, but I have network problems (no its not my internet connection). tested it with suicide squad, same issue.

Netflix,"Absolutely trash oh and by the way I'm cancelling my subscription, you don't even dare fall asleep watching anything or your phone bloody overheats to potential fire starting temperatures simply because you can't add a dam sleep timer or a way to stop it playing forever and when it does eventually throw up the message are you still there it stays on the screen and drains my phones battery to zero percent from 100%.

Netflix,"Tell me the reasons why Netflix is flagging my phone as a Widevine L3 certified when, in fact, my phone is more than capable of supporting Widevine L1? It keeps flagging my device as that. It is impossible to use/watch movies because Widevine L3 is like 480p in 2025... These movies tend to have a darker saturation than older movies, its not so comfortable to watch every pixel being dead is it? You better fix your protocol.",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,this app sucks! until 30th all the movies series everything was playing very good quality but since 1st may 2025 the video is distorted with pixels tearing up and green screen coming up and video is paused but audio keeps running.

Netflix,"Netflix has over the past 2 years improved a bit in it's range of Asian dramas & anime. However, I'm disappointed that there's still a massive absence in popular & current Japanese & Chinese dramas (particularly Japanese drama). Nonetheless, I think it's very good for those who watch content from America & Britain. They have a good range of documentaries here too.",3.0,Google Play
Netflix,I remember the days of ordering DVDs from you. Or how revolutionary streaming was in the early 10's. Now it's up to 21‚Ç¨ for a bloated selection of C tier wash and a handful of good productions that rotate out too quickly. Zero changes or innovation in the last decade minus adding pointless games.,1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"Waiting often weeks for anything new added that is interesting and something I haven't seen already or I see ones on here that are available on the free streaming channels. most of the new movies that get added now are foreign films, which I enjoy from time to time but I'd like to see some more new releases with 4+ ratings that are in English or dubbed. The free streaming apps I use like Tubi and a few others add new content more often without the audience having to pay a monthly fee. Do better!",1.0,Google Play
Netflix,"This app has become practically trash. I've never shown the slightest interest in the games but I keep getting them shoved in my face. I can't even browse for only TV shows or only movies.

Netflix,"shocking now adverts are introduced. It's an outrageous scam. you pay for the service, then need to pay for the removal of ads they put in to scam more money out of you. if you choose not to pay to remove, they annoy you by banging adverts every 10 minute's. it not even worth what you pay films are out dated or can pretty much watch anywhere.
