Oppenheimer,لا أعلم بشأن أخلاقية هذا سأعلق بحياديةكان الوثائقي صورة متجردة لرجل أنجب ناراً لن يطفئها التاريخ.. ليس بطلاً ولا شيطاناً و إنما عقلًا ممزقًا بين الاكتشاف والندم، بين العلم والضمير. في زمنٍ كان فيه الذكاء مرادفًا للقوة، يصبح أوبنهايمر مرآة لإنسانٍ اخترع نهايته بيديه، ثم وقف يتأملها بصمت..فعلًا العقول الأكثر ذكاءًا هي الأكثر ضعفا في وجه ما تصنعه,,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,Before watching the movie you must watch the series. Great political series which highlights how afraid the American government was well is still afraid of communism.,5.0,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"Watched over July 24-31.Almost impossibly, Nolan manages to cram far more story into his three hours then Davis does in his seven. Something, something, something, quantum physics, innit?It's fine, but why watch this when a shorter, far superior spectacle exists?",3.0,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"Sam Waterson softly saying that scientists shouldn't be involved in politics is more powerful than any of Nolan's loud noises, explosions and gimmicky flashforwards.",4.0,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,Lengthy but comprehensive BBC version which I haven't seen again since it first aired. Waterson makes for a less anaemic looking titular scientist but still captures the weary and worn-out vibe of a man haunted by his creation and by the vindictive paranoia of an establishment that shamefully turned its back on him.,4.0,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"I wanted to watch this mini series after seeing Nolan's Oppenheimer, I thought Sam Waterston was great, I'd hadn't seen much of his work when he was that young.",4.5,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"In the wake of Christopher Nolan's 2023 film, and their centenary, the BBC seemed to realise what a great wealth of culture they actually are, and have begun to make available some of their older work. Part of this includes their 1980 production, ""Oppenheimer"" a seven part biography on J. Robert Oppenheimer, starring Sam Waterston as the titular.Now, I'm a big fan of old television, but even I can admit when it's a bit of a slog. This mini-series…",3.0,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"What absolutely amazes me is that seven hours of this didn’t really give me anything new that wasn’t done or touched on in Nolan’s film (just allowed some of those things to breathe more and not be restricted to Oppie’s pov) but also still didn’t include the Strauss hearing or college Oppie so Nolan really is some fucking timey wimey wizard to get all that in three hours.Anyways, if you’re one of those with the main complaint about needing it in chronological order then try this.",3.5,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,where's florence pugh and emily blunt,2.5,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds""Seven part mini series detailing the life of Robert Oppenheimer, the man that guided the team that built the first Atom Bomb. Verdict....gripping well made drama covering a sensitive subject and a road in history that maybe the human race should not have taken!",4.5,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,Haha bomb go boom,4.0,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"It's 7 hours long. It's the BBC. It's the early 80s. It's got virtually no budget.You won't get flashy cuts, lush photography, Marvel/DC actors or Florence Pugh's boobs.What you will get, however, is a clever and thorough take on a very serious chapter of our recent history.It's not a blockbuster, guys, and why should it be? What a dramatisation of Oppenheimer's life needs to be is an encompassing look at a complex character becoming a key player…",3.5,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,American PrometheuZzZzZzZzZzZz,2.0,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"Very stiff, old school TV style acting and direction but - even if you haven't seen Nolan's version - clearly gives a very thorough account of Oppie's story. This perhaps struggles in the post war part of history as, inevitably, that's less interesting than the development of The Bomb. This is still worth your time though and makes you realise how far cinema has come.",3.0,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"choose da wrong one my bad. other one is top though, films got cillian murphy playing some tormented man for 3 hours thats just Cinema babeh",4.0,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,I don’t know what this is… but it’s on television and it certainly wasn’t Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer - at least I understood lots of the story and the names and context of the characters after seeing the 2023 film in IMAX Cinema. 💣,2.0,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"Wasn't even in five dimensions and didn't have any practical let alone computery effects, but they did quite wokely cast a nerd as Oppenheimer so that part was good.",1.5,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"In this series, Robert Oppenheimer is shown to be a Communist sympathizer, but his interest in politics is middling, and he gets bored with the Reds using his living room for their endless meetings. Postwar he says, ""panic and ignorance, it's a great combination."" The productive relationship between Oppenheimer and General Groves is nicely illustrated, each in their own way needed a problem solver, but for different problems. The set decoration and the costumes are good and the excellent cast is given a sharp script providing a nice authenticity. STEM nerds will geek out on the classroom and laboratory conversations.",3.5,Letterboxd

Oppenheimer,"Perfectly average '80s miniseries. I appreciated the work Sam Waterston does with his portrayal (infinitely better than the Dwight Schultz turn inFat Man Little Boy).I know it was just the date this came out and the time period it portrays, but this would have been great if it had been written/directed by R. W. Fassbinder!(Watched as part of my pre-Oppenheimerviewing list)",3.0,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"Dull, boring, meandering and informative.The cast does a creditable job. Sam Waterston is good as Oppenheimer. The cast members that portray AEC lawyer Roger Robb, Groves and Teller are also very good.The series goes into a fair amount of detail about the personal life of Oppenheimer, which I knew next to nothing about before seeing this, and it is worth watching for this alone.Any form of dramatic tension is missing, yes I watched this in preparation for…",3.5,Letterboxd
Oppenheimer,"Sam Waterston gives a great performance at the center but the series surrounding him struggles to meet his patrician tone. Still, for a BBC series produced in the late 70s and decades before AMERICAN PROMETHEUS it’s a noble attempt at making the whole Oppenheimer & Manhattan Project ordeal into something an audience can wrap its arms around.",3.0,Letterboxd

Barbie,"bastante mala pelicula como también representación, la mayoría de actuaciónes no parecen naturales, exceptuando a Margot, que cumple bastante bien su rol, pero la mayoría de la peli se siente forzada y sin profundizar.

Barbie,"what a blessing to be a girl & what a chaos it is as well.

Barbie,"Some very ham fisted monologues in this but it’s a very funny interesting movie and cements in my mind Margot Robbie as an actress who should be known as more than just Harley Quinn and just generally as a hot A list actress, and Ryan Gosling as someone who’s good in everything",4.0,Letterboxd

The heist within a dream idea is just so goddamn amazing how they pull it off here. The dream itself and how off kilter it all is. The shit between Cobb and his wife who he is suspected of killing.

The Banshees of Inisherin,Definitely a movie that I feel you have to sit with after. I don’t know much about the Irish civil war but it’s pretty obviously an allegory for the 2 main characters. The acting is just incredible. It made me feel every emotion that I am able. The ending was pretty damn bleak but sometimes things don’t pan out for the characters is the ways we were expecting. I wasn’t really thinking it would be a happy ending but wasn’t expecting it to go that way. Definitely recommend. Also the music is really good.,4.0,Letterboxd

It had some good humor, and made me second guess myself a couple times. the story line was really good, and the actors were good and had me convinced that the girl had killed the dude. but it was the funniest one out of all of them. i'd give this movie a solid 4 out of 5 stars",4.0,Letterboxd
Knives Out,I saw the movie i December 2019 .As Le Blanc Daniel Craig plays completely against type and steals several scenes . Christopher Plummer as the main character plays most of his scenes in retrospect . In what was sadly his last screen performance he was a=obviously having the time of his life . Jamie Lee Curtis and many seasoned performers including director Frank Oz play cameos . As Plummer's nurse and confidant a young Latino actor dominates the whole movie . Sadly I can't remember her name . A very entertaining mystery movie and a small masterpiece .,4.5,Letterboxd

Not enough for me to withstand the messiness and the cringe I got from the fish fucking.She brings home fish guy because she's so excited to find something that can't speak like her but that thing eats her cat - another creature that can't speak like her and whom she'd lived with much longer - and she's just like yeah I'll fuck that ig,2.5,Letterboxd

The Shape of Water,"Awful, I thought. Achingly, cloyingly twee, from the pseudo-Parisian music and rococo production design down to mannered, clanging performances; an under-imagined, paint-by-numbers plot; a romance that starts without any real motivation or magic and develops without a single genuine, touching moment. It's an amalgam of tropes and scenes stolen from other, better films (Amelie, ET The Extra Terrestrial, Delicatessen, Dancer in the Dark, Flipper, seaQuest DSV) that we're expected to tolerate because they are (*gulp*) Both Special Snowflakes.

The Grandmaster,"I feel like WKW either changed styles or was limited with his creative freedom.The film was beautifully shot with lots of slow shutter and camera choreography. But something felt off especially since Wong Kar Wai directed this. The style is a lot more combaty and matrix-like, which is probably what it was aiming for.",2.5,Letterboxd
The Grandmaster,"Wong Kar-wai crafts a poetic and visually stunning martial arts epic. The cinematography is jaw-dropping—each frame meticulously composed like a painting. His direction brings elegance and emotional weight to every scene, while the script and editing blend history and introspection seamlessly. The performances are mesmerizing, with Tony Leung anchoring the film in quiet power. Themes of legacy, identity, and sacrifice resonate deeply. A meditative and beautiful masterpiece.",5.0,Letterboxd
The Grandmaster,"(Chinese Cut)Beautifully crafted and performed, but it’s also too formal and grand for its own good. Rarely does the film really feel like a WKW film, which of course isn’t an inherently bad thing. Yet, it also restrains the film from being truly resonant. The fights kick ass at least.",3.5,Letterboxd
The Grandmaster,"A kung fu art-drama full of elegantly beautiful experiments, but Tony Leung is so invulnerable that there's hardly any suspense, or much sense that he's a man with a tragic past. It's obviously stupid to criticize a kung fu movie because its protagonist is an unbeatable badass, he just happens to be one of Wong Kar-wai's least contagious heartbreak-sufferers.",3.5,Letterboxd
